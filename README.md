# Operating Systems

This project entails the development of three distinct programs that showcase expertise in file manipulation, process management, inter-process communication, and randomization techniques in C. Each program addresses a specific problem involving text file processing, parallel execution, and inter-process communication.

The project highlights core concepts such as file handling, concurrent processing, and inter-process communication using C and system-level APIs. Each program introduces unique challenges, leveraging low-level system calls and external tools like pandoc to meet the given requirements.
